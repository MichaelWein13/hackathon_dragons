# To be written at end of Hackathon 
Notes:
1. Maybe should put in git.ignore so people don't what API key is
2. Example terminal line that will run the thing for you - (base) michaelwein@Michaels-MacBook-Air-4 hackathon_dragons % python -m demos.demo
3.  Replace api key in demo with actual api key, but when pushing changes to github, change it back or the key will stop working.
