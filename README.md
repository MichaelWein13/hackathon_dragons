# To be written at end of Hackathon 
Notes:
1. Maybe should put in git.ignore so people don't what API key is
2. Example terminal line that will run the thing for you - (base) michaelwein@Michaels-MacBook-Air-4 hackathon_dragons % python -m demos.demo
3.  Replace api key in demo with actual api key, but when pushing changes to github, it will have you replace it with something else.
4.  Here is API key - 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
